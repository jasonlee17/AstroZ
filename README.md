# AstroZ

This is my repository to store code used for my paper Astrometric Redshifts of Supernovae, in compliance with the LSST-DESC Software Summary Document

Here's a list of codes

To calculate MODEL

- Calculate MODEL DCR shifts on a grid of relevant parameters
- Calculate chi2 of each candidate on a grid of c and x1

To calculate OBS

Run SNANA for each case, then 

- Realistic case processing + results
- Systematic case processing + results
- Perfect case results

- LCFIT+z inputs

- Plots for Paper

Other codes are included in SNANA.
