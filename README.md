# AstroZ

This is my repository to store code used for my paper Astrometric Redshifts of Supernovae, in compliance with the LSST-DESC Software Summary Document

Here's a list of codes

- Calculate MODEL DCR shifts on a grid of relevant parameters (Calculate_model_shifts_by_color_x1_from_positive_SALT3_SEDs_LSST.py)
- Calculate chi2 of each candidate on a grid of c and x1 (DCR_AstroZ_calculate_chi2_split_lsst_all_types.py)
- Plots for Paper (AstroZ_final_Plots_for_Paper_v240127.ipynb)

Other codes are included in SNANA.
